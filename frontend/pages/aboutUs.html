    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project aims to predict Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), a key indicator of air pollution and atmospheric
      particulate matter, using a range of environmental and meteorological parameters such as wind speed,
      temperature, cloud cover, soil moisture, and humidity. The approach involves collecting multi-source data
      from satellite products like MODIS for AOD and NDVI, and reanalysis datasets such as ERA5 or MERRA-2 for
      weather-related variables. After preprocessing the data to align spatial and temporal resolutions and
      handling missing values, machine learning models—such as Random Forests or XGBoost—are trained to learn the
      relationship between these input features and AOD levels. The model is validated using standard metrics like
      RMSE and R², and further analyzed to understand the influence of each variable. The final output provides a
      predictive tool capable of estimating AOD across space and time, which can support air quality monitoring
      and environmental policy decisions.

    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <p>
      The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) by learning
      spatial patterns from environmental data such as wind speed, temperature, cloud cover, soil moisture, and
      related variables. These input parameters are formatted as multi-channel images or grids that represent
      different environmental layers over a geographic region. The CNN processes these inputs through
      convolutional layers that extract spatial features, capturing local and regional interactions among
      variables. By learning from historical data with known AOD values, the model identifies complex, nonlinear
      relationships between the input features and AOD levels. Once trained, the CNN can predict AOD for new
      environmental conditions, offering high-resolution, spatially-aware forecasts that are useful for air
      quality assessment and environmental monitoring.
